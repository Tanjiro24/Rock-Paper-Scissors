Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:

The Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is an interactive web-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the structure with buttons for the three choices (rock, paper, scissors). CSS enhances the design, adding colors and styling for a polished look. JavaScript adds functionality by handling user inputs, randomly generating the computer's choice, and determining the winner based on the rules of the game. It dynamically updates the results, making it an engaging and fun application.
